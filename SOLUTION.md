# Web Bot Upload Issue - Solution

## The Problem
The "failed to upload link" error is likely caused by one of these issues:

1. **Authentication Error** - Clerk authentication not working properly
2. **Server Not Running** - Backend server not accessible
3. **CORS Issues** - Cross-origin request blocked
4. **Port Conflicts** - Server can't start due to port being in use

## Quick Fix Steps

### 1. Kill All Node Processes
```bash
pkill -f node
```

### 2. Start Backend Server
```bash
cd server
PORT=5002 node server.js
```

### 3. Start Frontend (in new terminal)
```bash
cd client
npm run dev
```

### 4. Test Upload Without Auth
Create a test endpoint that bypasses authentication to isolate the issue.

## Root Cause Analysis

The main issue is in the authentication middleware. The current Clerk setup is causing the upload to fail.

## Immediate Solution

1. **Bypass Authentication Temporarily**
   - Use the test-upload endpoint without auth
   - Verify scraping works
   - Then fix authentication

2. **Fix Authentication**
   - Update Clerk middleware
   - Ensure proper token handling
   - Check environment variables

3. **Test Step by Step**
   - Test scraping function ✅ (works)
   - Test server startup ❌ (port conflict)
   - Test upload endpoint ❌ (auth issue)
   - Test frontend connection ❌ (server not running)

## Next Steps

1. Start server on different port (5002)
2. Update client proxy configuration
3. Test upload functionality
4. Fix authentication once basic upload works
